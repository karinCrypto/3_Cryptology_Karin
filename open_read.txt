(rt)
For seven days and seven nights
Man will watch this awesome sight.
The tides will rise beyond their ken
To bite away the shores and then

A fiery dragon will cross the sky
Six times before this earth shall die
Mankind will tremble and frightened be
for the sixth heralds in this prophecy.

The great star will burn for seven days,
The cloud will cause two suns to appear
The big mastiff will howl all night
When the great pontiff will change country.
